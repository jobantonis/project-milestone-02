### Literature Review

Your goal is to identify **three** papers in marketing, economics or computer science that are most relevant to your project.
For these most relevant papers, provide brief summaries using the template provided in the Rmarkdown document.
Here is the information we want provided for each paper:

* **Citation:** Give the correct citation of the paper.
* **Research Question**: What is the main question the paper wants to answer.
* **Question Type:** Is the question descriptive, predictive or causal?
* **Main Data Source**: What is the main data set used in the paper. What are the main dependent and independent variables.^[
  There is likely two or three, no more than five.
]
* **Methods:** What is the main "statistical" method used to analyse the data?^[
"Statistical" in a broad sense. Essentially what generates the main table of the text.
]
* **Main takeaway**: What is the **one** main finding of the article.

If along the way you have found interesting blog posts related to either the substantive topic or the techniques you are using include links to those in the subsection 'Relevant Blog Posts.'

### Exploratory Data Analysis

In the section 'Exploratory Data Analysis' provide **either**:

1. **ONE** table of descriptive statistics for the key variables you will use in your analysis and is suggestive of the relationship you want to study further, OR
2. **ONE** figure which highlights the key data pattern you are studying.

Write a short paragraph explaining the main takeaways. 
If you have filtered your dataset in any way by dropping rows of data, justify why what you have done is appropriate in this paragraph.
